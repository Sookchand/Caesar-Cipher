#  Caesar cipher {Python Game}
This Python code is an implementation of the Caesar cipher, a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. The `alphabet` list contains all the letters of the alphabet in order.

2. The user is asked to input either 'encode' to encrypt a message or 'decode' to decrypt a message. If the user enters anything other than these two options, they are repeatedly prompted until they do.

3. The user is then asked to input the message they want to encrypt or decrypt.

4. Next, the user is asked to input an integer which will be used as the shift number for the Caesar cipher. If the user enters anything other than an integer, they are repeatedly prompted until they do.

5. If the shift number entered by the user is a multiple of 26 (the length of the alphabet), it is incremented by 1 to avoid having a shift that leaves the text unchanged.

6. The `Caesar` function takes in three parameters: `start_text` (the text to be encrypted or decrypted), `shift_amount` (the number of positions to shift each letter), and `cipher_direction` ('encode' or 'decode'). It then iterates over each character in `start_text`. If the character is a letter, it finds its position in `alphabet`, calculates its new position by adding or subtracting `shift_amount` (depending on whether we're encoding or decoding), and appends the corresponding letter from `alphabet` to `end_text`. If the character is not a letter, it is appended to `end_text` as is.

7. After encoding or decoding, the function prints out the resulting text.

8. Finally, the user is asked if they want to run the program again. If they enter 'no', the program terminates; otherwise, it starts over from step 2.

## Lessons Learned
The lesson that can be learnt from this solution is:

- How to use Python to implement a simple encryption and decryption algorithm based on the Caesar cipher.
- How to use lists, strings, loops, conditional statements, and functions in Python.
- How to use the `input` function to get user input and validate it using `try` and `except` blocks.
- How to use the `lower` method to convert strings to lowercase and the `index` method to find the position of a character in a list.
- How to use the modulo operator (`%`) to wrap around the alphabet when shifting letters.
